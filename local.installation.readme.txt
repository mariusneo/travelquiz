Travel Quiz Local Installation Instructions
===================================================


In order to install locally the travelquiz web application, once the directory travelquiz is on your computer,
please perform the following steps :

- place the images that you want to browse through the travel quiz within the directory travelquiz/img/photos

- construct an Excel file with the following columns :
    - image
    - lat
    - lng
    - description
  and fill the values corresponding to the following template :
        IMAG0200.jpg	47.297036	8.632480	Glarus, Schweiz

  The image names are the image filenames copied in the directory travelquiz/img/photos

  The values for lat and lng can be retrieved by using the website :
    http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html

  Note that the description column is optional and doesn't necessarily need to be filled.
  A sample coordinates.xls file can be found in the installation directory.

- open in Chrome web browser the file travelquiz/coordinates-generator.html and choose your own coordinates.xls file in
  order to generate the coordinate.js file. This file will be used in the travelquiz web application for storing the
  coordinates for each of the images.
  When the coordinates.js file was generated successfully, you should see it in the downloads bar of your browser.
  Take the downloaded file coordinates.js and replace it with the file coordinates.js from the folder travelquiz/js/


That's it. Have fun !!
In order to use travelquiz, open the file travelquiz/index.html with Chrome web browser and try to guess where the image
that you see was taken.


NOTE : Repeat the steps above anytime you want to add/replace/remove images into the travelquiz
